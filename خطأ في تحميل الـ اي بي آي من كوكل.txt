There are various solutions mentioned in #788 that may help. To summarize, the options are this:
Download the cacert.pem file
Do one of the following
set curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO/cacert.pem" in php.ini 
pass the file in the verify option to your Guzzle client, i.e.:
$client->setHttpClient(new \GuzzleHttp\Client(array(
    'verify' => 'C:\Windows\curl-ca-bundle.crt',
)));
