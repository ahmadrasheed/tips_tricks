when clone laravel project from gitHub, some files will not be downloaded :

.env
vender 
..... etc 

because when doing push into gitHub, these files in included in ignore file. so they will not be upleaded to gitHub.

whaty will fix that? 

- try to make composr update or composer install 
- remove any file from ingnore file, before and after gitHub process.
- make .env , this file contain all information about connecting to DB.
